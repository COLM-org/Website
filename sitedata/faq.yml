      - Question: What is the COLM preprint policy?
        Answer: "COLM will use the following policy, adapted from NeurIPS: 'Non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, social media, websites, etc.) are permitted. We recommend you indicate ‚Äúpreprint‚Äù, rather than the ‚Äúfinal‚Äù option int he template (the template currently doesn't support it, bu there's a <a href='https://gist.github.com/yoavartzi/893d95852d32872a98e71eac8b6fd3ff'>gist to help you</a>). Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Authors may submit work to COLM that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv) without citing it; however, previously published papers by the authors on related topics must be cited (with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing; see below)."
      - Question: Will COLM have a short paper track?
        Answer: "COLM will not have a separate track for short papers for the 2024 call. We appreciate the value of short papers, but we are opting for simplicity for the first iteration."

        Answer: "COLM will does not have a separate track, reviewing, or call for position papers for the 2024 call. We are opting for simplicity for the first iteration, so will not solicit for position papers, because to be treated properly, they require a different reviewing process. "
      - Question: Will COLM solicit or accept survey papers? 
        Answer: "We don't have a special track for survey papers.  If you wish, you can submit a survey paper and we will route it to the appropriate area chairs and reviewers and based on their judgment, you will get a decision."
